    Cats are one of the most beloved household pets. As of 2023, there are
    almost 400 million cats being kept as pets around the world. Felines are
    fascinating creatures who can come in all different shapes and sizes. In
    fact, there are about 73 total cat breeds.

    One main characteristic of cats that people use to differentiate between
    breeds is their fur. Long haired cats are fluffy and require consistent
    grooming to maintain their coat. On the other hand, short haired cats have a
    sleek, shiny coat that most cats can maintain themselves. When adopting a
    cat, it's important to consider each breed and their traits to determine
    what cat is the best fit for you.
